# Study Generator

Study Generator Web App @ [studygenerator.com](https://www.studygenerator.com).

-----------------------------------------

The frontend serves the user separately from the backend. The frontend of Study Generator holds all the UI content including the several flashcard features, such as shuffle and hints. One of the primary goals while developing this product was to emphasize simplicity and minimalism and we are fairly confident that we achieved just that to provide a delightful user experience to be an efficient product - paste, click, and study!

# Goals

We built StudyGenerator.com in order to help students more efficiently learn information. Instead of having to go through and make their own review, StudyGenerator goes through the text and generates flashcards for you, so you can quiz yourself to make sure you are understanding and comprehending the content.
